Project Made during Technigo Bootcamp, Survey-project.

## 1. What is this?
This week's project was to use React to build a survey form. It should ask a couple of questions and when the user presses submit it should show a summery of their answers. The focus is to practice using React state and controlling forms.


## 2. What did I do?

In this project I used react to create my survey. I used the react hook `useState` to rerender the state of the components and to show different components based on where the user are in the survey. 

I created the form using a form box, a dropdown and radio buttons. When first given the assignement, I started up by planning the design and how it should be structured, and then I decided how many components I thought was neccesary. Before writing everything in vscode, I experimented alot in codesandbox to see how you could approach different problems. 
If I had more time, I would try to use conditional statements based on the answers from the user, maybe show different pictures and so on. 


## 3. Where can you see it in action?
